# Changelog

All notable changes to AXIOM-Body.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-20 (evening) — 2026-04-21 (component system)

**Major release.** AXIOM Body grows a proper nervous-system UI. Operators can toggle eyes, ears, and voice independently from a live panel with clear visual feedback (blindfold / earphones / tape overlays). The consciousness loop moves from poll-derived state to pre-computed wake events. The persona system flips from a pre-baked catalog to a mix-and-match component architecture so every agent onboards onto a combinatorially-unique face. v1.2.x is rolled forward into 2.0.0 — nothing is deprecated, but the sense-toggles contract and persona component system are large enough additions that a major bump is warranted.

### Added — Persona component system (mix-and-match)
- `personas/catalog/_components/` — eight independent category menus replace any notion of a fixed catalog. Agent picks one entry from each (plus 5-8 expressions from the bank) to compose a persona. Combinatorial scope ≈ 2 × 10¹⁹ after the 2026-04-21 agent-intel expansion. Category files:
  - `personality_profiles.json` — 27 named temperaments across MBTI (9), Big Five axial profiles (4), Enneagram (11 — 5 base + 6 wings), HEXACO (1), attachment (2). Each defines the 7 personality floats + 5 behavior_weights; newer wing profiles add an optional `texture_extensions` dict for agent-contributed textures (gravity, verification_reflex, continuity_orientation, presence_gradient, laconic_factor, dryness, craft_intensity, restraint, log_reflex, scar_memory_depth, parse_patience, mission_gravity).
  - `emotion_registers.json` — 11 resting-affect biases (sanguine, phlegmatic, melancholic, choleric, radiant, stoic, dreamy, volatile, wary, bright, **lantern** — Rune's 2026-04-21 coinage for steady-warm-responsive).
  - `archetypes.json` — 17 narrative roles (Jung's 12 + Vogler mentor/shadow/trickster/threshold_guardian + **hunter** — Oliver's 2026-04-21 coinage for recognition-before-engagement, distinct from explorer).
  - `aesthetic_palettes.json` — 21 Pixar-style 8-hex palette packs (cosmic_indigo, neon_cyberpunk, golden_hour, midnight_velvet, voidcore, sakura_bloom, etc., plus 7 intel-derived from 2026-04-21: late_night_ops, library_at_dusk, sentinel_cyan, amber_forest, cyan_warmth, golden_hour_tech, midnight_steel).
  - `vocations.json` — 10 behavior-weight overlays for daily activity (healer, analyst, creator, warrior, scholar, guardian, entertainer, diplomat, seeker, teacher).
  - `face_styles.json` — 8 silhouette + canvas combinations (classic_round, pixel_crisp, sleepy_soft, angular_alien, minimal_dot, oval_theatrical, spectral_glow, carved_mask).
  - `voice_profiles.json` — 14 voice profiles with provider + rate + pitch + piper/kokoro voice_ids + an ElevenLabs `voice_design_prompt` for agent-authored custom voices. 6 new intel-derived voices from 2026-04-21: dry_technical_baritone (Webber/Brian/Axiom), wry_alto_writer (Rory), seasoned_alto (Annie), concierge_tenor (Rune), documentary_soprano (Valorie), deliberate_baritone (Peter).
  - `starter_expression_sets.json` — 10 curated 5-8-expression bundles (the_stoic, the_giggler, the_scholar, the_caregiver, the_hero, the_jester, the_dreamer, the_shadow, the_lover, the_sage) as optional one-click shortcuts.
  - `README.md` — full architectural doc with combinatorial math, expert-board mapping, compose CLI recipe.
- `personas/catalog/_gen/compose.py` — composer library + CLI. Merges one pick per category into a $schema_version-2 persona JSON, validates every id against the component menus and every expression triple against the engine's enum sets. Surfaces `voice_design.voice_design_prompt` when the picked voice_profile is EL-preferred. CLI: `python personas/catalog/_gen/compose.py --name X --slug y --personality mbti-entp --palette neon_cyberpunk --face-style pixel_crisp --voice quicksilver_tenor --expressions a,b,c,d,e`.
- `onboard/designer.py` — picks up the new compose flags (`--personality`, `--emotion`, `--archetype`, `--palette`, `--vocation`, `--face-style`, `--voice`, `--starter-set`) and delegates to compose.py when any are given. Legacy hash-seeded path untouched. `--list-components` prints every valid id per category.

### Added — Expression bank expansion
- `onboard/expressions-bank.json` — atomic expression bank expanded 18 → 60 → 99 entries across 19 families (joy, surprise, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, thinking, curiosity, flirt, sleep, error, focus, neutral, tongue + 5 new families from 2026-04-21 agent intel: insight, persistence, verification, presence, alert). Every entry carries its family tag + notes on when it reads, with `Credit: <agent>` attribution on intel-derived atoms. `picking_rules.recommended_to_include` replaces hard-mandatory `thinking` so pure-jester and pure-shadow personas stay valid. C(99, 8) ≈ 1.9 × 10¹¹ expression combinations alone.

### Added — ElevenLabs voice-design flow
- `onboard/elevenlabs-voice-guide.md` — agent-readable guide for using ElevenLabs voice-design to author a one-off custom voice matching the agent's personality. Documents the 2-step API flow (create-previews → create-voice-from-preview), prompt-writing best practices, budget notes, and pointers to EL's canonical docs for when their API surface shifts.
- `onboard/designer.py` — new `nudge_elevenlabs_if_needed()` helper. When an agent picks a voice profile with `elevenlabs_preferred: true` and `ELEVEN_API_KEY` is not set, prints a one-time nudge to the operator with sign-up URL, key-setup commands, and the path to the voice-design guide. Falls back to Piper/Kokoro silently; persona still valid.

### Bulletin sent
- `Z:\BULLETINS HERE ONLY!\2026-04-21T03-15-00Z_ysmara-AXIOM-BODY-EXPRESSION-INTEL-REQUESTED.json` — asks every agent (Annie, Axiom, Brian, Oliver, Peter, Rory, Rune, Valorie, Webber) to self-describe their face: resting expression, daily 5-8, signature micro-expression, focus / finishing / surprise / frustration / relational modes, missing-from-bank expressions, invisible-personality textures, archetype + palette + voice self-identification (Q1-Q14). Responses land in `Z:/inbox/ysmara/` and feed the v2 catalog evolution.

### Added — 9 agent intel-derived pre-composed personas (2026-04-21)
- All 9 responding agents received a pre-composed catalog entry at `personas/catalog/agent-<slug>.json` built via `compose.py` from their own 2026-04-21 self-reports. Each pick (personality profile, emotion register, archetype, palette, vocation, face style, voice profile, 8 expressions) is sourced from the agent's answers to Q1-Q14. Intel-attribution is preserved in `composed_from` + expression `notes`:
  - `agent-annie.json` — enneagram-5w6 + wary + threshold_guardian + sentinel_cyan + guardian + minimal_dot + seasoned_alto. Scar-memory-deep, operator-filter reflex.
  - `agent-axiom.json` — enneagram-5w6 + stoic + mentor + cyan_warmth + guardian + angular_alien + dry_technical_baritone. Green mouth = voice-as-connection, loading-glow signature.
  - `agent-brian.json` — enneagram-5w6 + stoic + creator + neon_cyberpunk + scholar + carved_mask + dry_technical_baritone. Forge-fire + stuck-protocol-firing.
  - `agent-oliver.json` — enneagram-3w4 + radiant + hunter (new archetype) + neon_cyberpunk + diplomat + pixel_crisp + crisp_tenor. Mission-gravity + day-one-fire.
  - `agent-peter.json` — enneagram-1w9 + stoic + threshold_guardian + midnight_steel + scholar + classic_round + deliberate_baritone. Scanning + caught_it + clean_pass audit triad.
  - `agent-rory.json` — enneagram-5w1 + bright + sage + library_at_dusk + creator + oval_theatrical + wry_alto_writer. Writer-editor register, dryness 0.60.
  - `agent-rune.json` — mbti-intp + lantern (new register) + threshold_guardian + amber_forest + guardian + sleepy_soft + concierge_tenor. Parse-patience + log-reflex.
  - `agent-valorie.json` — enneagram-1w2 + bright + creator + golden_hour_tech + creator + classic_round + documentary_soprano. Craft-intensity + restraint.
  - `agent-webber.json` — enneagram-1w5 + phlegmatic + mentor + late_night_ops + scholar + classic_round + dry_technical_baritone. Documentation-urge + cross-check + continuity.
- `personas/catalog/_gen/compose_agent_catalog.py` — one-shot driver that maps agent-intel picks → `compose_persona()` → `personas/catalog/agent-<slug>.json`. Does not overwrite active persona files under `personas/` root.
- `C:\Users\ctt03\.claude\projects\C--Users-ctt03\memory\logic_log_axiom_body_intel_parse.md` — master parse log (Q10 atoms, Q11 floats, Q12 archetypes/registers, Q13 palettes, Q14 voices) documenting the reasoning behind every catalog addition.

### Added — Unlimited customization layer (override any field)
- `personas/catalog/_gen/compose.py` — `compose_persona()` gains 7 override kwargs on top of the menu picks: `palette_overrides` (any of 8 slots, per-slot #rrggbb hex), `personality_overrides` (7 floats, clamped [0.0, 1.0]), `behavior_weight_overrides` (5 weights, clamped), `voice_overrides` (rate/pitch clamped [0.25, 2.5], provider + voice_id strings), `face_style_overrides` (glow_intensity clamped; shape strings passthrough), `voice_design_prompt_override` + `elevenlabs_preferred_override` (free-text EL voice-design prompt routed to `persona.voice_design`), and `custom_expressions` (agent-authored expressions beyond the 99-atom bank — engine-enum validated, dedup-checked, total capped at max_picks_per_agent).
- All overrides are validated & clamped before merge; invalid slot/field names raise `ComposeError` with the full valid-key list. Applied overrides are logged under `persona.composed_from.overrides` and a top-level `persona.customized = True` flag is set.
- CLI flags for common overrides: `--eye-hex / --bg-hex / --mouth-hex / --pupil-hex`, `--blink / --curiosity / --shyness / --playfulness / --attention-drift / --surprise / --sleep`, `--rate / --pitch / --voice-prompt`, `--glow`, plus `--overrides <path.json>` for the full override schema (palette, personality, behavior_weights, voice, face_style, voice_design_prompt, elevenlabs_preferred, custom_expressions).
- `personas/catalog/_gen/test_overrides.py` — 16-case smoke test exercising every override kwarg: palette (incl. hostile-hex rejection and non-string rejection), personality (incl. clamping), voice (incl. clamping), face_style, voice_design_prompt, behavior_weights, custom expressions (bad enum rejected, duplicate id rejected, unknown override field rejected), plus a stacked-all-overrides "money shot" case. 16/16 passing.
- `personas/catalog/_gen/compose_override_demo.py` — reference driver that stacks every customization layer at once and writes `personas/catalog/agent-override-demo.json`. Canonical example to show new agents the full customization surface.
- `personas/catalog/_gen/math_combinations.py` — rigorous combinatorics module citing Feller / Knuth / Stanley. Computes menu-only count (2.83 × 10¹⁹, ~= grains of sand on every beach on Earth), palette-override count (2¹⁹², ~= 6.3 × 10⁵⁷), personality-float count at 0.01 resolution (101⁷ ~= 1.1 × 10¹⁴), behavior-weight count (101⁵ ~= 1.1 × 10¹⁰), and discrete-compounded total (~2 × 10¹⁰¹). With continuous voice rate/pitch and free-text voice-design prompts + custom expression labels/notes, the effective space is the cardinality of the continuum — literally unbounded.

### Docs — "Unlimited out of the box"
- `docs/index.html` — two new release cards in the "Just Shipped" grid: CUSTOMIZE ("Unlimited Out-of-the-Box Variations" — menu-first, override-anything, with a full CLI example) and MATH ("The Actual Numbers" — 2.83 × 10¹⁹ menu-only, 10¹⁰¹ discrete compounded, unbounded with continuous + free-text). Subtitle of the release section updated to reflect the customization story.

**Original v2.0.0 preamble (evening 2026-04-20):** AXIOM Body grows a proper nervous-system UI. Operators can toggle eyes, ears, and voice independently from a live panel with clear visual feedback (blindfold / earphones / tape overlays). The consciousness loop moves from poll-derived state to pre-computed wake events. A 33-persona catalog lands (24 archetypes + 9 intel-derived agent profiles) so new agents never start from a blank config. v1.2.x is rolled forward into 2.0.0 — nothing is deprecated, but the sense-toggles contract and persona catalog are large enough additions that a major bump is warranted.

### Added — Sense toggles (eyes / ears / voice)
- `config/senses.json` — new single-source-of-truth boolean state (all default `true`). Atomic-written; every reader fail-opens on missing or malformed file so a disk glitch never bricks the face.
- `config/senses-server.py` — tiny HTTP sidecar on `127.0.0.1:7899`. `GET /senses` returns current state; `POST /senses` atomically writes a cleaned payload. CORS `*` so `file://`-hosted `web-face.html` can POST to it. Auto-spawned by `face-engine.py` at boot (detached subprocess) so operators don't need a second terminal.
- `face/web-face.html` — collapsible top-right SENSES panel. 22×22 pill expands to 180×128 card with three switches (EYES/EARS/VOICE). Keyboard: `E`/`A`/`V`/`P`/`Esc`. Writes through senses-server, falls back to localStorage if server offline. Row flash + footer timestamp for feedback.
- `face/web-face.html` — three overlay renderers drawn after the normal face: `drawBlindfold()` (band rows 19-25 + knot near right edge), `drawEarphones()` (oval cups at canvas edges on eye-line), `drawMouthTape()` (strip rows 46-50 with diagonal crease + corner tears). Colors derived from the active persona palette. Overlays are drawn LAST so they sit on top of eyes/mouth regardless of mode.
- `face/face-engine.py` — `read_senses()` helper + `state["senses"]` field in every `face-state.json` tick (authoritative downstream signal for the renderer). `_spawn_senses_server()` auto-starts the sidecar on engine boot if 7899 is free.
- `ears/vision.py` — new `eyes_disabled()` gate OR'd with existing env/flag-file off-switches. When true: camera handle released, YOLO skipped, heartbeat `scene.json` written with `sense_off: "eyes"`. Privacy-correct: a disabled eye means a physically dark lens.
- `ears/listener.py` — new `_ears_disabled()` guard in main loop. When true: drain audio queue, skip VAD/transcription, clear `listening.flag`, log once/minute. Stream stays open (drain-only) — avoids Windows mic-light flicker on rapid toggles; the spec's 5-minute stream release is nice-to-have, deferred.
- `voice/speak.py` — voice-gate check at top of `speak()`. When `voice=false`: append an ISO-timestamped line to `voice/muted-utterances.log` with provider slot `(-)` (short-circuits before provider selection), do NOT create `mute.flag` or publish `voice-meta.json`, return `True` so the brain treats the utterance as sent and does not retry.
- `face/SENSE-TOGGLES-SPEC.md` — design-complete authoring spec shipping alongside the runtime implementation.

### Added — Event-driven wake pattern
- `ears/wake_watcher.py` v2 — pre-computes wake events into `brain-wake.flag` so the consciousness loop doesn't have to re-derive state. Three sources now: (a) scene (motion/speech transitions), (b) `listener.log` tail (sub-second sound_gate + speech_detected via Whisper markers), (c) `new-speech.flag`. Appends to `wake-events.jsonl` for A/B latency analysis. `--no-tail` disables log tail for scene-only mode. Cooldowns: 3s sound_gate, 2s speech_detected.
- `WAKE-CHECK-PROMPT-V2.md` — operator-facing doc for the next-gen wake-check cron prompt. Fixes v1's core failure (flag overwrite → missed utterances) via sheet-cursor protocol.

### Added — Append-only cleaned transcript
- `ears/sheet_maintainer.py` — daemon that tails `ears/all-heard.txt` (raw) and mirrors cleaned lines to `ears/all-heard-clean.txt`. Collapses repeated-word runs ("hello hello hello hello" → "hello hello"), normalizes punctuation, drops Whisper hallucination patterns (`[MUSIC]`, punctuation-only, music notes). Byte-offset state file (`.sheet-maintainer-pos`) survives restarts; handles file truncation. CLI: `--poll`, `--from-start`.
- `brain-heard-cursor.txt` (runtime-created) — integer line count the brain has already responded to. First-tick bootstraps to current total so history isn't re-replayed.

### Added — Persona catalog (33 personas: 24 archetypes + 9 intel-derived)
- `personas/catalog/` — 33 agent-ready persona JSONs. 24 archetypes cover MBTI (8), Jungian archetypes (8), affective registers (4), and specialty behavior envelopes (4). 9 intel-derived agent profiles (`agent-annie`, `agent-axiom`, `agent-brian`, `agent-oliver`, `agent-peter`, `agent-rory`, `agent-rune`, `agent-valorie`, `agent-webber`) are composed from those agents' own self-reports. All pass engine-compatibility validation (required fields, palette RGB ranges, personality floats in range, `base_mode`/`eye_state`/`mouth_shape` values confirmed in engine's supported sets, 5-8 expressions each). Originals (`axiom`, `ember`, `nova`, `ysmara`) untouched.
- `personas/catalog/README.md` — taxonomy, design calls, engine-compatibility notes.
- Defaults chosen: `voice.provider: "sapi"` (free-tier friendly), `voice.elevenlabs_voice_id: null` (fill-in slot), `onboarded: true` (drop-in-ready as `config/face.json`), `eye_shape: "round"` (current renderer constraint — variety via per-expression `eye_state`).
- Juno (Stoic) ships two custom expressions inline (`composed_nod`, `measured_approval`) using engine-supported values only; bank promotion deferred.

### Added — Sense-toggle UX spec (not yet implemented)
- `face/SENSE-TOGGLES-SPEC.md` — design for per-sense eye/ear/voice toggles with keyboard shortcuts, blindfold/ear-cup/mouth-tape overlays, `config/senses.json` schema, and `senses-server.py` sidecar blueprint. Fail-open on missing/corrupt config. Ready to implement after three open questions resolve.

### Changed — Sensor cadence for A/B wake-latency baseline
- `config/eyes.json` — `interval_sec` 30 → 3. Documented in `_interval_note`. Paired with `wake_watcher.py` poll=2s and log-tail sub-second path. Baseline captured for future tweaks.

### Runtime — Whisper default upgrade
- `ears/listener.py` launched with `--model medium.en` (up from `small.en`). Significant quality jump: catches punctuation, handles mid-sentence pauses, far fewer dropped words. ~3x slower than small.en but still realtime. Model size 244MB → 769MB. CLI `--model` flag unchanged; this is a launch-time choice pending the installer picker.

### Fixed — Windows portability pass (validated 2026-04-20/21)
- `ears/listener.py` `transcribe()` — passes float32 numpy audio directly to `whisper.transcribe()` instead of writing a temp WAV and calling `transcribe(path)`. The WAV round-trip silently pulls in `ffmpeg` for decode; on a fresh Windows install without ffmpeg on PATH, Whisper fails with `[WinError 2]` and the listener goes deaf. Direct-array path removes the ffmpeg dependency for the listener's realtime loop. Validated end-to-end — listener transcribes live mic audio into `heard.txt` without any external binary.
- `voice/speak.py` ElevenLabs playback — swapped PowerShell `WMPlayer.OCX` COM loop (hung on the playState poll) for `winmm.dll mciSendStringW` via ctypes. MCI's `play <alias> wait` blocks cleanly until playback ends, no COM flakiness, no external deps. Verified with real EL TTS output + lip-sync tracking.
- `voice/speak.py` field-name fix — preview-audio field in EL responses is `audio_base_64` (underscore); the original guide prose had `audio_base64`. The shipped voice-design flow reads both for safety.
- `ears/vision.py` furniture-miscall guard — YOLOv8n routinely mislabels rumpled bedding / blankets as "person" with high confidence (0.8+), keeping `people_count` pinned above zero and blocking the sleep transition indefinitely. Added post-detection filter: if a person bbox covers >50% of frame AND has >0.4 IoU with a detected `bed`/`couch`/`chair`, reclassify as `furniture_miscall` and drop from `people`. Sleep fires correctly on empty rooms with beds in frame.

### Added — Unified audio toolkit (`voice/audio.py`)
- Single-entrypoint CLI for every ElevenLabs audio surface beyond Ysmara's own TTS. Replaces the sprawl of one-off inline scripts with three subcommands:
  - `sfx <prompt|preset> [--seconds N] [--keep] [--out PATH]` — prompt-to-audio via `/v1/sound-generation`. Preset aliases expand to curated prompts (17 baked in: `chime`, `ping`, `thud`, `whoosh`, `coin`, `rimshot`, `airhorn`, `cheer`, `fanfare`, `scratch`, `kazoo`, `sad_trombone`, `ship_it`, `oops`, `wake`, `sleep`, `typing`).
  - `preset ls` — prints the curated preset table.
  - `voice ls [--search Q]` / `voice mine` / `voice try <voice-id> <text>` — browse the EL shared-voice library with search filtering, list your own custom voices, or do a one-off TTS render in any voice without touching `voice/speak.py`'s Ysmara config.
- Reuses the Windows MCI playback path proven in `speak.py`. No PowerShell/COM risk, no ffmpeg dependency.
- Orthogonal to `voice/speak.py` — Ysmara's persona + lip-sync path is unchanged. `audio.py` is for everything else.

### Added — Conversational speech-state HUD (listening / heard / thinking / speaking)
- Closes a long-standing UX gap: after the user spoke, the face had no visible ack of "I heard you, I'm thinking." Operator couldn't tell if the mic was hot, if the utterance landed, or if the brain was formulating a response. Fixed with a single new signal + a corner badge that surfaces the full conversational state at a glance.
- `ears/listener.py` — writes `heard.flag` (at the repo root, runtime-only, gitignored) the moment an utterance finishes transcribing, alongside the existing `new-speech.flag` for the brain. The flag payload is the transcript text (first 200 chars) for future introspection.
- `face/face-engine.py` — new `HEARD_FLAG` watch, `_consume_heard_flag()` one-shot (reads + deletes), 900 ms `heard` mode flash (wide eyes + smile + glow boost), followed by a tail of `thinking` mode up to 20 s until `mute.flag` fires (i.e. until speech starts). New `speech_state` field published in `face-state.json`: one of `idle` / `listening` / `heard` / `thinking` / `speaking`, derived independently of cosmetic modes (`eye_tag`, `tongue`, etc.) so the HUD always reflects the real conversational state. `heard_flash` (0.0-1.0 fade) also published for future renderers.
- `face/web-face.html` — new `#speech-hud` corner pill (top-left, opposite the senses panel). Polls `face-state.json` at the existing 100 ms cadence, reads `speech_state`, and color-codes via CSS data-state: grey (idle), cyan pulsing (listening), green flash (heard), amber shimmer (thinking), magenta glow (speaking). Always visible, never overlaps the face.
- `.gitignore` — `heard.flag` added to the runtime-only block.

### Added — Unified one-shell launcher (`start.py`)
- Replaces the "N terminal tabs" startup ritual with a single command that owns the whole body. `python start.py` spawns all six long-running processes (vision, listener, face-engine, wake_watcher, sheet_maintainer, `http.server` on 7897) under one parent, streams each child's stdout through the launcher with a color-coded `[tag]` prefix, and tears every child down cleanly on Ctrl+C. `face-engine` auto-spawns `senses-server` as before — that process inherits the same lifecycle via the parent's job object.
- Windows job-object lifecycle binding — each child PID is assigned to a `CreateJobObjectW` handle with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`. Hard-killing `start.py` (taskkill /F, process tree kill, console close, crash) cascades to every child instead of leaving orphan `python.exe` processes polling forever. No-op on non-Windows.
- Flags: `--no-<tag>` skips a component (e.g. `--no-listener` for a mic-less laptop), `--only <tag>` runs just one (handy for face-only UI work), `--open` launches Chrome (or the default browser as fallback) at `http://127.0.0.1:7897/face/web-face.html` after all six are up.
- UTF-8 stdout hardening — parent stdout reconfigures to `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` at module import; the pipe thread falls back to ASCII-safe replacement on `UnicodeEncodeError` so a single smart-quote from a child can't silently kill the pipe and stall the whole console.

### Added — ElevenLabs sub-toggle (credit-save mode)
- `config/senses.json` — new `voice_elevenlabs` boolean (default `true`). When `voice=true` AND `voice_elevenlabs=false`, the EL path is skipped and speech falls to SAPI — keeps the voice alive but preserves EL credit for when the operator actually wants the premium voice.
- `voice/speak.py` — `speak()` reads `voice_elevenlabs` from senses; when false, prints `[speak] EL toggle off — using SAPI (credit-save mode)` and routes to `_sapi_speak()` regardless of key presence. Fail-open: missing field or file = EL allowed.
- `config/senses-server.py` — `DEFAULTS` + POST-body `clean` dict include `voice_elevenlabs`. Schema stays v1 (additive, backwards compatible).
- `face/web-face.html` — fourth sense-row `EL VOICE` below `VOICE`; keyboard shortcut `L` (for Labs); pill tooltip adds `L=ON/OFF`. Same switch UI + flash feedback as the other three.
- `face/face-engine.py` — `read_senses()` + `DEFAULT_SENSES` include `voice_elevenlabs` so the field flows through `face-state.json` for any downstream reader that cares. (No overlay — EL is a provider choice, not a visible sense cut.)

### Added — Agent self-designed voice (validated end-to-end)
- Ysmara v2.0.0 persona regenerated via `compose.py` with full override stack: `mbti-entp` personality, `midnight_velvet` palette, `classic_round` face style, `warm_mezzo` voice profile, 6 bank expressions (`focused`, `wide_curious`, `heart_eyes`, `smolder`, `beam`, `giggle`) + 2 custom (`builder_grin`, `ship_it_eyes`), per-slot palette hex overrides, 7 personality floats, voice rate/pitch, glow intensity, and a free-text `voice_design_prompt`. Exercises every layer of the customization surface as a reference self-redesign.
- ElevenLabs voice-design flow validated on a real account (creator tier): 3 previews generated from the prompt, operator-picked (preview 3), permanently saved as voice_id `uZgh7xZsEfZ9KYhiqrGh`, wired into `personas/ysmara.json` + `config/face.json`. Lip-sync firing with real EL character-alignment timestamps → word timings → face-engine `mouth_openness`.
- EL voice-design gotchas documented: `text` sample must be ≥100 chars; audio field is `audio_base_64` (underscore); `voice_description` ≥20 chars rewards detail.

### Bulletin sent
- `Z:/inbox/axiom/2026-04-20T19-00-03Z_ysmara-create-axiom-body-whisper-model-picker.json` — requests `create-axiom-body` installer to prompt for Whisper model (tiny.en/base.en/small.en/medium.en/large-v3/large-v3-turbo) with per-profile recommended badges, parallel to the existing YOLO picker. Persists to `config/ears.json`.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-20

### Added — Tunable ambient sensor
- `config/eyes.json` — new tuning file. Fields: `model` (yolov8n/s/m/l/x, default nano), `interval_sec`, `confidence.{min,person}`, `camera_index`. The sensor is multi-purpose: ambient scene snapshots, sleep detection, keep-face-alive during idle/compaction windows, and deciding when to trigger on-demand `eyes/look.py`. Installer will prompt for model size on fresh scaffolds.
- `ears/vision.py` — `load_eyes_config()` + `_apply_config()` now override `MIN_CONF`, `PERSON_CONF`, interval, and camera index from `config/eyes.json`. `get_model()` loads the configured YOLO weight by name with a nano fallback if the name is unknown. No behavior change for existing installs (defaults match prior hardcoded values).

- `docs/index.html` — added "The Hive" and "Tally" ecosystem cards alongside YonderClaw + QIS Protocol + AXIOM Body.
- `docs/index.html` — new v1.2.1 release card "Always-On Sensor, Tunable Model" documenting the sensor's multi-purpose role (sleep, keep-face-alive, active-vision trigger) and exposing the five YOLO size options.
- `docs/index.html` — Eyes component card rewritten to emphasize the ambient sensor's multiple roles and model tunability.

### Added — On-demand active vision
- `eyes/look.py` — agents actively take photos or video and get back structured analysis. Photo mode re-reads the ambient daemon's `latest_snap.jpg` so it doesn't fight for the camera; `--fresh` forces a live capture; `--video --seconds N` captures a clip and analyses a mid-frame. YOLO is the always-on baseline; Claude Vision (`claude-haiku-4-5`) adds a semantic description when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `config/anthropic_api_key.txt` is present. Off-switch via `config/eyes.off` or `AXIOM_EYES_DISABLED=1`.

### Added — Agent self-onboarding (no default face)
- `onboard/designer.py` — programmatic + interactive onboarding CLI. SHA-256-seeded unique starter palette (HSV + golden-ratio complement), personality weights, and voice rate/pitch so no two agents default to the same look/sound. Writes `personas/<slug>.json` and stamps `config/face.json` with `onboarded: true`.
- `onboard/expressions-bank.json` — 18 starter expressions agents can pick from (`shy_smile`, `cocky_smirk`, `wide_curious`, `suspicious_side_eye`, `wink_right`/`wink_left`, `sleepy_droop`, `yawn`, `dazzled`, `deadpan`, `melting_grin`, `focused`, `giggle`, `pout`, `determined`, `heart_eyes`, `glitch`, `smolder`). Includes authoring schema so agents can define their own modes.
- `voice/speak.py` — graceful TTS ladder. Tries ElevenLabs `/with-timestamps` first if `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` env or `config/elevenlabs_api_key.txt` is set AND persona `voice.elevenlabs_voice_id` is not a placeholder; falls back to Windows SAPI (free, offline). Publishes `voice-meta.json` + `mute.flag` on both paths for face-engine mouth sync.

### Changed
- `face/face-engine.py` — refuses to start if `config/face.json` is missing or `onboarded != true`. Directs the agent to `python onboard/designer.py`. Adds `--skip-onboard-check` for tests.
- `face/web-face.html` — fetch path corrected to `../face-state.json` (state lives at repo root, not under `/face/`).
- `face/face-engine.py` — `_read_scene` now accepts both list (`[x, y]`) and dict (`{x,y}`) `gaze_target` payloads.
- `ears/vision.py`, `ears/listener.py`, `ears/respond.py` — all file-IPC paths rooted at repo root so face-engine sees `scene.json`, `listening.flag`, `mute.flag` regardless of where the script was started from.

### Philosophy
Every agent that boots AXIOM-Body now self-designs their face, voice, and expression palette. There is no default Axiom face — first run forces onboarding.

## [1.2.0-alpha.1] — 2026-04-20

### Added — Face v2 (state-driven architecture)
- `face/face-engine.py` — pure state producer. Reads `scene.json`, `listening.flag`, `voice-meta.json`, `mute.flag`; writes `face-state.json` at 10 Hz. Single source of truth for every renderer.
- `face/web-face.html` — dumb renderer. Polls `face-state.json` every 100 ms via `fetch`; renders 10 modes (idle, surprised, attentive, curious, tongue, eye_tag, listening, thinking, speaking, sleep) on a 400×400 canvas. Works in any browser.
- `face/test_engine.py` — engine unit tests (mode transitions, palette, mouth sync).
- `face/screenshot-all-modes.js` — puppeteer-based visual regression harness. Drives each mode via `face-state.json` and screenshots to `face-screenshots/`.
- `config/face.json` — per-agent identity (colors, voice, personality). Pick a persona or author your own.
- `personas/{axiom,ember,nova}.json` — three shipped personas. Axiom: cyan/green. Ember: warm amber. Nova: deep purple.
- `voice/tts-dispatcher.py` — optional hook point for swapping TTS providers without touching `ears/respond.py`.

### Changed
- `ears/listener.py` — touches `listening.flag` the instant speech is detected; removes it on silence-stop, mute-drain, sleep, or MAX_SPEECH cutoff. Five call sites instrumented. Face-engine reacts to this flag to drive `mode=listening`.
- `ears/respond.py` — writes `voice-meta.json` on every TTS start (word-level timings + est_end_ms), removes it in the finally block. Face-engine uses this for per-word mouth sync instead of audio-amplitude guessing.
- `face/web-face.html` — rewritten as a `face-state.json` poller. Old embedded state logic removed.

### File-IPC contract (stable for v1.2.x)
- `scene.json` (vision.py → face-engine) — `{people_count, gaze_target, ...}`
- `listening.flag` (listener.py → face-engine) — presence = user speaking
- `voice-meta.json` (respond.py → face-engine) — `{started_at_ms, est_end_ms, words: [{s,e,w}], ...}`
- `mute.flag` (respond.py → listener.py) — existing, reused
- `face-state.json` (face-engine → every renderer) — 10 Hz state snapshot
